## Content and Flow
***

* HomePageScreen: Landing Screen that contains an overview of the ship the user own, but also of the 
components the user owns with their quality. From here, the user can see the Orders History by 
pressing on the top right button or can create an order by pressing the button in the bottom right.
* OrdersScreen: The user will firstly choose what components he wants to buy and then choose a
date and an hour when we wants to get those components. After these details he will be forwarded
to the shops screen.
* ShopsScreen: In this page, the user can see what shops are available to complete his order, along 
with the total price, rating and distance from him. The user can search for a specific shop or just
filter them using the button in the right side of the search text box. After choosing a shop, he can
place the order by clicking the top right button which will send the order to the Orders History.
* OrdersHistory: The user can see his orders history list, each item containing some important 
details and by pressing on a card, it will reveal the components of the order and the price at which
they were bought according to the shop's prices

## What I could do better
***

* I would have modularized the code much more.

* I would have used validators for each stage.

* I would have created a better UI.
